FUAM and FCA are both a part of the Fabric Toolbox GitHub repo. They are solution accelerators (so no MS support) but the community is great and they are well-documented.

To learn more Fabric and stay in the know:
r/MicrosoftFabric subreddit - close to 18k members, including lots of MS employees and MVPs. Has become my go-to to stay on top of what's happening in the Fabric world, as well as case studies, lessons learned, etc.

Fabric hub on Microsoft Learn (seems obvious - but this landing page is a great hub to find guides, how-to's, whitepapers, etc.)
